## Web API Project

# Introduction
This project is a web application that incorporates the use of APIs (Application Program Interfaces). 
We will source the API used in this project from [here](https://rapidapi.com/categories).

# Credit
We want to credit the developers of the APIs we used in this section. The APIs were:
- [matchilling](https://rapidapi.com/user/matchilling)'s Chuck Norris API, which can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/matchilling/api/chuck-norris)
- [fyhao](https://rapidapi.com/user/fyhao)'s Currency Exchange API, which can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange)

Both APIs were free to use.
